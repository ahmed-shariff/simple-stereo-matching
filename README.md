The concept behind the algorithm developed and documented in this report is that edges are crucial to recognizing the depth. Specifically the edges that have a direction in the direction normal to the displacement of the two images. That is, if two images were taken of the same scene side by side at the same time, then the depth (distance of a point in the image from the plane the images were taken) can be measured by calculating the disparity of similar edges, that have a value in the direction normal to the direction of the displacement of the images. If the images were taken where the displacement of the images are only in the x-axis, then the edges that have a value in the y-axis needed to calculate the disparity. The edges parallel to the displacement are of no use to the calculation of the disparity, hence the edges parallel to the displacement are discarded in this algorithm. The algorithm that has been developed thus far only covers the calculation of the disparity of the edges as mentioned above.
